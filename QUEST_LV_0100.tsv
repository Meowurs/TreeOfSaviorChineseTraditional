QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006957	So you are the revelator. The believers are having a hard time due to the thorny bushes.{nl}How about you help them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006958	The evil force was first felt in 欺詐森林. {nl}The force was very strong so it will remain this way for a while even if you get rid of 博拉波.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006972	Salvation... Would I be able to have hope.{nl}Then， I will count on you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006973	You gotta find a way to block the magical power that will be injected with the magical stone of the interaction.{nl}If we could find the documents that Balryus left at Beiniki Prayer's Room， it may not be a meaningless dream...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006974	Salvation... That's the word that I forgot for a long time. I thought hope was extravagant.{nl}All I could do was just depress for a long time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006975	Okay. Was the document present?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006976	Magic generating stones.{nl}They are at the room of senses and the room of rituals.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006977	I know the basic composition. I've researched it when I was alive.{nl}But， it won't react if it's not Balryus magical power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006978	You can find the artifacts of Balryus from Bebaiki chamber.{nl}The magical power would still be there since Balryus was a great magician.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006979	I am sure the magical power still remains.{nl}There's no other way so I hope it still exists.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006980	It's fortunate that the magical power still remains.{nl}First， let's stop the magic generating stone near the room of senses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006981	I hid the magic generating stones among the fakes in the room of senses.{nl}But， with the brooch you found， you will be able to distinguish the real ones from the fakes.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006983	I felt earnestness for the first time in hundreds of years.{nl}To prevent it from ending meaninglessly， I will pray to the 女神es.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006984	The magical power that came from the room of senses has completely disappeared.{nl}Now， we just have to block the room of rituals.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006985	The room of rituals is slightly different from the room of senses.{nl}Although， they are the same that you have to shut down the magical power of all magic generating stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006986	You will know how to handle it when you control it yourself.{nl}But， if you feel something went wrong， use the magical power of Balryus.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006987	With the warp magic field under me， you could quickly go to the room of rituals.{nl}I hope you are successful...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006988	The magic generating stones in the room of rituals affect the other magic generating stones nearby.{nl}We could start over with Balyus' magic.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006990	We are all ready. But， that Akorn is different from the Akorn from your era. {nl}It may be better to leave it like that.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006991	We have an other way. The sealed artifact among Balryus artifacts...{nl}I heard there are some of them in Uzdaromo stone chamber that were created to suppress the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006992	I already gave up the hope that I would be free a few hundreds years ago.{nl}In fact， I still can't believe it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006993	The seal that is suppressing the demonic energy... that's it.{nl}Now everything is ready.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006994	Now， when the magical stone of the interaction stops， I will be free with Akorn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006995	I will tell you one more time. You should not think of Akorn that was present in your era.{nl}It will be hard without using the seal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006996	In fact， I am okay even if I disappear like this.{nl}It's so thankful that you care for me， but I don't want you to get hurt.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006997	We are almost at the moment of being released from the restraint that was on us for hundreds of years.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007009	But， it seems that the ink won't be smeared due to the mosses.{nl}The juice of Crout Grass will solve it. I forgot to bring it when I came back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007010	Don't accept the forecasts of the oracles as the foresight of the future.{nl}Sometimes， they could help us determine what's right and wrong as we live on.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007011	Was it difficult? But， you will soon know.{nl}You will soon find the clue that would solve the interwined world.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007013	You will see the effects right away when you rub the grass juice on it， but you should leave it for a while.{nl}The mosses will go away.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007014	It wasn't effective? I guess the moss is not normal.{nl}Hmm. Then I guess I should ask Bidotas. There must be some way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007015	Okay then I will go. {nl}Ah， can I ask you to get the 骨頭 powders of monsters?{nl}I need something sticky that would help the ink to be smeared well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007016	Luckily， Bidotas gave me a good one.{nl}I heard you should use this special ink with the sticky liquid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007017	Okay. I want you to do the last rubber copy with this.{nl}My legs ache since I travelled too far...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007018	I have a good feeling about this.{nl}Don't you think we may be able to find decent forecast this time?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007019	The world for the death of the death also would exist
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007020	{nl}Death after death? This... This may be the forecast that I was looking for.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007021	I should research more on this forecast. {nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007022	While I am interpreting this， I will give you the rope with a magnet so please go to the well with that.{nl}I saw a gold plate on the floor. If that's the plate， it will come up after being attached.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007026	Difficult， difficult...{nl}The words are hard to understand.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007027	I guess it was the gold plate.{nl}It was lucky that the well was dried... If not， it could have been horrible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007028	I will organize them and show you later.{nl}You are the revelator. They will help your journey to find the 女神es.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007029	It seems that the gold plates that you've brought can't be worked due to the rusts.{nl}Why did they record on the gold plate...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007030	In fact， I didn't know what this gold plate was.{nl}Since this place is the hometown of Demetrius， I came here expecting something may be present.{nl{
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007031	Nothing was engraved on it， rather it was full of rusts.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007032	At then， my eyes were ignited with flame.{nl}Demetrius has something to tell you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007033	Yes. Now is not the time to just complain. First， I should make the rust remover.{nl}I want you to obtain the inner 核心 of Hallowbenter Magician.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007034	Get rid of the rusts with the rust remover and maintain it with the anticorrosive agent. {nl}If it weren't you， I wouldn't have done it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007035	Fast indeed.{nl}Okay. I will make the acidic solution with this. It will become the basis of the rust remover.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007036	Secondly， when we sprinkle the rust powders， some monsters react.{nl}Collect some boiling liquid from that monster. A lot of it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007037	Ah. If you sprinkle it too much， it may endure all the monsters nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007038	I went to meet 煉金術士 in Mine Village because of Rust Remover and Acidic Solution.{nl}He was being so arrogant...

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007044	Someone should research at the camp and the other person should look for the gold plate.{nl}That's why I am here. I am not a coward like Yustas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007045	Now， I know all the locations of the gold plates， but I can't do anything about the monsters.{nl}It is so fortunate that you would help me. really.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007046	This reaction reagent only reacts to the gold plates from the specific era.{nl}The gold plate that shows boiling response is the one that we are looking for. You understand right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007047	We gotta distinguish the real ones by finding out when the gold plate was created.{nl}We should look for the gold plate that was built before the establishment of the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007048	The next one is at Apsuba Hall.{nl}The gold plate is under the bushes in the corner， but I can't do anything about it myself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007049	Originally， it was forgotten and was deep in the ground.{nl}But， the day of the divine tree was in fact beneficial.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007050	As the land caved over， they were carried away to the various places in 歷史遺跡...{nl}That's our prediction.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007051	Be careful all the time. The monsters here rush in scarelessly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007052	It is a disaster to someone and it is a blessing for the other.{nl}I can remember the words from the old literature.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007053	Oh! That's it. Give it to me. Let's see... I should first make it corrode.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007054	The gold plate that you found for me a while ago... I think the next part is remaining.{nl}The gold plate that I know is that one so I don't know what to do from now.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007056	Bring this detector.{nl}From the place where you can feel the reaction， the gold plate must be there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007057	That's it! Now we found all the records.{nl}You've done it well. Now， I should sprinkle this rust remover so give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007058	As I expected， this gold plate was the last one.{nl}Now we've collected all gold plates... I think I know what's written on them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007059	Can you give this to Yustas?

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008326	{nl}It's nothing difficult. You just have to go near Orsha or 克萊佩達 and help the Revelators who just began their adventures. {nl}I will give you a scroll. If you use it on them, it will help them and promote the merchants as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008327	You must use it near the fields of Orsha or 克萊佩達. {nl}And it must be someone who just began their adventure. {nl}I will not work on people who have seen the promotion material already.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008328	謝謝你 for stepping up to help.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008332	{nl}Let's take time to talk later but first, please help excavate the area I tell you .
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008333	It would also be nice to take care of the monsters on your way there too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008334	It won't be that dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008335	Oh, you brought it. {nl}This is a divine object known as the Incense of Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008336	Did I tell you? {nl}Oh, it was a long day... {nl}We faced Medis Diena right here while we were transporting the divine objects to Orsha.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008337	{nl}The wagon flipped and the divine objects scattered around. {nl}That's why we are going through this excavation to find it. {nl}But people are hesitating to excavate that area because of the monsters... Please help us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008338	I wonder if it was eaten by the monster...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008339	Looks like the monsters ripped it to shreds but here. {nl}Let me try to have it back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008340	{nl}Since it is the record of the merchants, only if I could stick it back together...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008341	This record is about the materials of the arrow that the merchants supplied to Lydia Schaffen and her arrow maker, the first Fletcher MAster.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008351	{nl}If you want to help me... {nl}Please find the records of the merchant that the monsters stole from us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008352	As Leopoldas says, we, the merchants, have been doing a lot of things. {nl}The records hold the history of our works.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008353	If we get back the records that the monsters stole from us, then we must rewrite them again so that it will stand the times.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008354	謝謝你 for coming forward to help us. {nl}We are in really tight hands.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008355	Now we have to rewrite the damaged records... {nl}The ink made from monster fluids are good and lasts long. {nl}I will give you a trap to use so please get me the monster fluid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008356	If you place the trap near the monster, the monster will be lured to it and faint. {nl}You need to extract its fluid while it is still alive.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008357	You can get it from all the monsters around the area.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008358	This is good enough! {nl}非常感謝!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008359	Now it's time to make the sanctuary. {nl}Try to make it here. {nl}I will give you the materials and tools you need.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008360	You can make it here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008361	Good work. {nl}I have a feeling that Gierda, in the northern area, also needs your help.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008362	Gierda
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008363	You're the Revelator. {nl}I am Giedra of Rud order. {nl}If you're here to meet Antanas, I'm sure you've already heard about our order so I won't talk so much about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008364	{nl}I am collecting the materials needed to make the Scriptures of Goddess. {nl}Normal paper turns yellow and decays quickly... So I'm looking for materials that won't get wet nor be discolored easily. {nl}The transparent shell of the monsters are great for it. If you polish it well before writing on it, it will last a long time. {nl}Can you get me those? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008365	It's a pretty common material so it will be easily to collect.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008366	Bring it to me when you collect them all.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008367	You brought them earlier than I expected. {nl}These shells will now be polished and used as pages of the scripture. {nl}謝謝你.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008368	We also need to do some bookbinding. {nl}Making sure the book does not break lose is the most important thing. {nl}The leather string made from monster leather is the best but the problem is that it is too short. {nl}I will give you an anvil. Can you make me some bookbinding strings using the leather strings?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008369	Listen carefully. First, get leather string from the monsters, then use this anvil to turn the leather strings into a strings for bookbinding. {nl}You need to connect the short strings and make it into a single string. {nl}It also becomes more durable this way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008370	Return to me when you are done making the string.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008371	Awesome! {nl}You can say that you made a book yourself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008372	{nl}Kestas over there also needs your help. Try talking to him.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008374	I had the records of my seniors...{nl}But it was all stolen... {nl}I'm done...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008375	Oh oh oh!{nl}Please help me!{nl}My seniors' records are all gone!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008376	{nl}That's my job but it's all gone! All of it! {nl}Please find it! {nl}I'm sure the monsters took it!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008377	What to do... What do I do... {nl}I'm done... All the hardworks put in to make those records...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008378	{nl}That's it! Wow, you got them all! {nl}謝謝你!{nl}How can I 謝謝你 enough...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008379	Aah it's all good now! Now go back to Orsha and complete the records!{nl}Hahaha!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008380	Ah really... {nl}Actually, these records are made out of the polished shells of the monsters. {nl}You need to write it there to make it last long.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008381	{nl}Yes, yes, right. That is also why Gierda is trying to make the scripture using the monster shells. {nl}That's why we are always attacked like this. {nl}Because they can smell their fellows...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008382	{nl}Anyway, now I'll really go to Orsha now. {nl}非常感謝!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008383	Chisel?{nl}The tools merchant should have it. {nl}Go on over there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008384	It's a long way back with the tool... {nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008385	A Chisel? {nl}You will use it to repair the sanctuary?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008386	{nl}Well, I just bought some old chisels from other Revelators... {nl}If you need, you can take one of it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008387	Did you get the chisel?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008388	Oh, you got them all.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008389	It's a long way to Gernas Plains... {nl}Go on.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008390	Albinas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008391	謝謝你 for what just happened. {nl}Ah, this sanctuary...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008392	{nl}I expected it to be polluted but.. I mean who would have thought it would be this bad? {nl}Making a sanctuary like this here is bad enough but those Nestos. {nl}What are they thinking leaving it corrupted like this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008393	{nl}Can you help me out for a while?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008394	I belong to the Anastos. {nl}The Nestos still pursue unconditional belief even at this point when the Goddesses are all gone. {nl}That's why they are building sanctuaries here and there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008395	{nl}What's the use of sanctuaries when the Goddesses are all gone? {nl}When you know it will just be corrupted like this even if you build it. {nl}On the other hand, the Anastos pursue practicality.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008396	{nl}People come first, mopping up the demons come first, and what's the use of faith when the Goddess themselves abandoned us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008397	There is another sanctuary over there. {nl}I will finish burning this sanctuary so please destroy the one over there. {nl}We need to teach those Nestos as lesson.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008398	{nl}I'm sure the sanctuary over there is also fuming red enegy. {nl}A sign of corruption.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008399	Damijonas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008400	What the... {nl}Who are you? What are you doing to our sanctuary...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008401	This is the sacred sanctuary of the Nestos. Did you do this?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008402	I have never heard about someone like that. {nl}I may not know every singe person in Anastopas but I at least know those who set up this camp.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008403	I'm at loss for any word.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008404	{nl}Albinas? He is one of Anastopas? That can't be. {nl}Bring that person here. I need to check for myself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008405	Are you saying that Albinas guy is missing? {nl}It's getting out of hand. {nl}I'm sure Anastos won't do such a thing.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008406	{nl}Anyway, our priority then is to restore this sanctuary. {nl}You did this so you should be responsible for it. {nl}There are rocks over there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008407	{nl}This sanctuary was also made of the rocks here so collect some rocks. {nl}And the Nestos Camp is over there. {nl}You'll find someone named Eduinas . {nl}Ask him to polish the rocks to use as materials for restoring the sanctuary.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008408	If he finds out you did this to the sanctuary, he won't polish the rocks easily. {nl}But that's a price you have to pay and you should be responsbile for it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008409	Still not done yet?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008410	Eduinas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008411	Who are you..? {nl}And what are these rocks?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008412	What? Destoryed the sanctuary? {nl}The sanctuary that was built with everyone's efforts here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008413	I don't need your apologies. {nl}I'll polish the rocks to use as materials since Damijonas said so but don't ever do that again. {nl}And while I polish these, I don't want to see your face so go away and take care of some monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008414	You should wait longer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008415	Done. Now, don't ever do that again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008416	You brought it. {nl}Now let's begin the restoration.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008417	Done. It's a good thing it wasn't totally destroyed. {nl}I apologize for being angry at you a while ago. Seeing the sanctuary destroyed was upsetting. {nl}But it's not total nonsense. {nl}Anastos and Nestos may be in conflict of interests but we do not invade each other's territory.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008418	{nl}But you mentioned someone from Anastos that I don't even know as the reason behind destroying the sanctuary so I couldn't hold my anger. {nl}Anyway, at least you restored it...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008419	{nl}But it strange. I have never heard of that name...{nl}Anastos Camp is in the northern side so why don't you go there and ask. {nl}It really is strange.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008420	Gedas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008421	Don't bother me if you don't have any business. {nl}Ah... I really need that...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008422	{nl}Hey, can you find it for me? {nl}My research materials. {nl}The monsters took them all from me...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008423	More than other things, we need to find it first! {nl}My research! My research! {nl}The monsters took it! {nl}Find me that first!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008424	Are you not done yet?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008425	Let me see... {nl}Yes, right! You got them all! {nl}非常感謝!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008426	{nl}Oh, did you have something to ask?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008427	Albi...nas...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008428	{nl}Uh...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008429	{nl}Nope. I can't think of anyone on Anastos with that name. {nl}Moreover, he hold you go burn and destroy the Nestos sanctuary? {nl}Oh my god...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008430	{nl}Nonsense. We don't do such a thing. {nl}I think we need to investigate on that matter. {nl}We give danger signal fires when we send out people for investigation {nl}and we ran out of it just now. {nl}Can you find some firepowder that are used to make the danger signal fires?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008431	We all servce the Goddess. That is why we're on the pilgrimages. {nl}It's just a small difference in how we see the world.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008432	{nl}Nestos people say that we should believe in the Goddesses unconditionally even if they disappeared, {nl}while we, the Anastos, pursue something more practical.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008433	{nl}Defeating demons, improving the qualities of human lives... we have to aim for those things.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008434	Monsters are all around so it will be difficult to obtain the materials.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008435	But, Albinas... We don't feel good about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008436	Okay, good. That's enough.{nl}Now, we will make flame bombs. Please wait a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008437	We've completed the flame bomb... Now I will call my colleague.{nl}He is called Fabius.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008438	Fabius is a moderatist among Anastos, so he won't have problem even if he meets one of Nestos on his way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008439	Since Fabius left... we would somehow get some answer.{nl}But, I don't feel good about it. Is there any information...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008440	{nl}Ah! Barte over ther must know something.{nl}He arrived here while travelling various locations.{nl}How about we ask about Albinas there?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008441	It's just a different perspective of looking at the world. {nl}The topic they cover the most...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008442	{nl}The disappearances of the Goddesses were done spontaneously so are we going to still follow then after they abondoned us...{nl}Another problem is whether we, humans should continue to manage the world where the Goddesses have disappeared...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008443	{nl}Are we going to aim for the truth or trust the Goddessses and pray... that will be the difference.{nl}But, they are just conflicting each other and they don't deny each others' existences.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008444	She is rather progressive.{nl}So since she is not close to me... I want you to go to her.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008445	Barte
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008446	{nl}Ah, yes. I am called Barte.{nl}I was on a journey until recently. I am thinking about leaving againn.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008447	Albinas... Is that him?{nl}When we arrived at the camp recently, one man was wearing the same outfit like us so I was going to say hello, but then I felt something was not right so I decided not to.{nl}He was giggling as he was looking at the leathers that were engraved with writings and he ripped off those leathers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008448	{nl}I was scared since that wasn't the power of a human, but he threw all those leathers on the ground and disappeared down there. The monsters thought that was the time and ate all the leathers. Was the smell of blood on those leathers?...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008449	{nl}It was scary. {nl}Ah, I think the monsters there could've not digested the leathers as yet... {nl}Can you bring them? I am curious too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008450	The people who are progressive are a minority among Anastos.{nl}They are asserting to stop conflicting with Nestos, but instead try to change Nestos.{nl}So that Albinas probably told them he is also progressive.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008451	{nl}So he could make you participate into destroying the sanctums of Nestos.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008452	I can connect the burnt leathers together.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008453	The monsters have those.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008454	Let's see...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008455	{nl}Uh?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008456	{nl}Ah... This doesn't make sense... He...is a subordinate of Vaiga.{nl}Bring a conflict to Nestos and Anastos...{nl}You can use the Revelator...{nl}Vaiga.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008457	Please tell this to Gedas!{nl}Oh my god, what is happening to Fabius?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008458	We don't have time. Hurry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008459	What?{nl}Damn it...{nl}The demons came here...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008460	Fabius... what is happening to him?{nl}What should I do...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008461	The flame bomb has exploded!{nl}Please hurry to Fabius!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008462	{nl}And one more thing I should tell you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008463	{nl}To defeat the demons, Nestos may be better, when you stop by their camp and explain about the circumstances, they would tell you how to defeat Albinas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008464	Damn...{nl}That was his plot.{nl}I thought it was suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008465	{nl}Please take this divine object.{nl}You would be able to defeat the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008466	You are safe.{nl}I've heard from Fabius.{nl}Everything was Vaiga's plot...{nl}We should be cautious all the time.{nl}謝謝你.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008467	It's bad enough that they were killed by the Vubbes, but even their keepsakes are being abused. How awful...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008468	謝謝你. {nl} My comrades will now be able to rest in peace.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008469	It hurts to think about giving these keepsakes to my dead comrades' families.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008470	非常感謝. {nl} My comrades can now rest in peace with the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008471	Damn. {nl}It's too wide so let's move seperately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008472	First, you go deep into that place.{nl}Who knows? The demons with the special power may possess something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008473	I am so mad.{nl}There isn't anything special and the demons didn't have anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008474	Did we search an empty area?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008475	I will search the area up here.{nl}Let's meet later.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008476	How about you?{nl}Have you obtained anything?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008477	Wait!{nl}I can sense something big from Monocle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008478	It looks to be very big. Go there and check yourself.{nl}I will hide here since the battles are not my type.{nl}I don't know what to do if a strong demon comes out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008479	Monocle is looking for the hidden object that is hidden inside the special power. It is a big object.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008480	Go there and chek.{nl}Like a while ago, the demons may appear and there may be really strong demons there... I will hide myself here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008481	An outsider comes here... Who are you?{nl}How did you come here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008482	It is really big so you will recognize it when you see it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008483	I will introduce myself first.{nl}I am the manager of the Fortress of the Great Earth.{nl}Who are you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008484	Okay. You don't have to explain anymore.{nl}I can feel you are full of sacred power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008485	I know the special power which Ruklys hid here exists.{nl}If it is your task to find it, then I will help for sure.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008486	You can't say no nor ask for reasons to the kingdom orders.{nl}But as I lived here for my life, I have many things to think.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008487	The kingdom order told us to ban anyone's entrance here, but I think the Goddess made us to meet each other here.{nl}The Goddess is not under the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008488	If it is about the Goddess, then I will do the guide.{nl}At least, there aren't anything here so let's go to the next area.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008489	Ah, I totally forgot.{nl}I've prepared many things to block the intruders, but I totally forgot about them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008490	I need a cerificate.{nl}It was created to attack the ones who are not permitted ferociously.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008491	To make a certificate, we first need a mushroom.{nl}There are many mushrooms at the lower area so please get me one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008492	I will help anything that is related to the Goddesses.{nl}Finally, an opportunity has come in my boring life.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008493	They are enough to make the certificate.{nl}Please wait a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008494	What I can do for you is to put my sign on the certificate.{nl}But, I am too old to use magic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008495	But, I am sure the energy that is flowing around the Fortress of the Great Earth could substitute my weak power.{nl}Please gather all of those.{nl}The monsters who've lived here for a long time must have the crystal of the great earth.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008496	I am not like the old days.{nl}When I made that certificate, I thought I would never make anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008497	I never knew that I would be making this again... Please wait.{nl}I will make it quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008498	Let's go more deep inside. {nl}I hope you can find the one that you are looking for. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008499	I will go there first so please follow.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008500	Don't come late.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008501	Welcome.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008502	Please receive it.{nl}My devices won't attack you anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008503	I've protected this place for my entire life, but I don't know anything about the revelation which you are looking for.{nl}But, the spirit that lived in the era of Ruklys may know something.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008504	But, those spirits are dangerous.{nl}Since they only have the thoughts of that time. Their hatred towards the kingdom soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008505	The Soul Stones that read the memories of the spirits are beside me.{nl}I've created them. I've tried to read their memories in the past many times.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008506	But, what we received in return were only hatred.{nl}For them, we are just kingdom soldiers that are trying to occupy the Fortress of the Great Earth.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008507	It is unfortunate, but to make them not to go crazy, you would need the token of the restraint.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008508	It is very complex to make the token of the restraint.{nl}We've failed that time, but since we have you this time, it will be much easier this time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008509	I will tell you in steps, so please first bring the eggs of Rajatad.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008510	The spirits only have the feeling of anger left.{nl}I guess we can't do anything about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008511	This egg is the power to restrain.{nl}Now, we need something to execute the power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008512	To execute the power, the bones of the demons are the best.{nl}When you get the bones, I will move the power of restraint that is in the eggs to the bones of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008513	Even I failed to pull out the memories of the spirits.{nl}I feel reliable since you are with me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008514	Well done.{nl}We only have to do the last step in order to complete the token of the restraint.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008515	As I told you before, I've tried to look at the memories of the spirits.{nl}The resistances from the spirits were too aggressive at then, so I failed that time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008516	But, now I have you and the token of the restraint.{nl}If we could bring the spirtis, we may able to read the memories with the soul stones that are beside me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008517	Please bring the spirits here with the token of the restraint.{nl}I will get prepared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008518	Please bring the spirits fast.{nl}I am also curious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008519	They are breaking something after receiving an order from Ruklys.{nl}I think that may be related to the revelation of the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008520	I should find out about the device which Ruklys destroyed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008521	We can look at the detailed memories of the spirits by enhancing the token of the restraint.{nl}Due to enhanced token of the restraint, the spirits would resist. If the spirits resist, suppress them with your power and use the token of the spirit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008522	I have no choice even if the spirits suffer. {nl}That's the best way I can help you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008523	Finally found it.{nl}I've been looking for it for 600 years and finally... found the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008524	Please put the vitality of the monsters into this bone.{nl}Then, the power to restrain, the power to release, and the power to execute, all steps will be put into those.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008525	That's an old method.{nl}If we complete this, you may able to see the memories of the spirits that were with Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008526	Even we if we know the method, it is useless if we can't execute it.{nl}I wasn't able to obtain the vitalities of the monsters...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008527	Good. {nl}That's the token of the restraint.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008528	Don't care that much even if we use the demons.{nl}What's important is that we should look for the revelation of the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008529	Are there spirits that are wandering around the Fortress of the Great Earth without going to the Goddesses?{nl}I can't see them suffering anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008530	I can only help you to make the owl sculptures.{nl}Those owls would guide the spirits that lost their ways.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008531	Can you put the sculptures of the owls at the Fortress of the Great Earth?{nl}If you guide the spirits to the owl sculptures, then you would be able to go beside the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008532	I can't quit carving the owl scuptures.{nl}When I stop carving, then that means the peaceful days have come.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008533	Thanks.{nl}The Goddesses must have given use long lives to fulfill these.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008534	I don't have time to think about those treasures.{nl}I also care for the kingdom. I know that the revelation should not fall into the hands of the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008535	I should meet Eminent around here.{nl}Let's check with Monocle without being noticed by Eminent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008536	This is as I thought... He is not like the guardian of the revelation.{nl}Otherwise, are the demons the guardians of the revelation?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008537	They are going after the revelation.{nl}What should we do about it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008538	That's right!{nl}We have that document.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008539	Do you remember?{nl}It's the document that was in the treasure when we went to the hidden place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008540	The methods of the activation and the repair of the magic circle is written there to face against the demons at the battle field.{nl}If we somehow use them effectively, we may able to block Eminent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008541	First, you do what Eminent tells you to do.{nl}And let's secretly activate the magic circle with me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008542	Did it go well?{nl}The last thing is near the Ikbeta Platform.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008543	But, the power of the magic circle is getting suppressed due to the flags of the demons.{nl}I've tried to get near it somehow, but I can't due to the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008544	Let's pull out the demon flags that are near the magic circle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008545	Ah, if you go late, Eminent may suspect you.{nl}Go meet Eminent as the magic circle gets activated.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008546	I believe that Ruklys has not colluded with the demons.{nl}If not, what I saw are all lies.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008547	Have you collected all the parts?{nl}Give it to me. I can restore it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008548	I want you to meet the revelation of the Goddess fast.{nl}To fulfill my lifelong wish...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008549	I will not hide it anymore.{nl}I am Premier Eminent and I used to serve King Kadumel.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008550	It's up to you to believe, but I want you to give me an opportunity to at least explain this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008551	I am sure that you know this place is the last battlefield where Ruklys resisted til his death.{nl}And Ruklys was also the guardian of the revelation like his master, Maven.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008552	But, as the defeat came, he crossed the line which he should've not crossed.{nl}He made an alliance with the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008553	The Fortress of the Great Earth is full of vicious demons and monsters. {nl}That's why I brought my army here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008554	It was a long battle. But the battle ended with my victory.{nl}And then the voices of the Goddess was heard. To protect the revelation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008555	But, I don't know how Ruklys hid the revelation.{nl}He is just a half guardian.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008556	It's up to you to believe this story, but look at me in front of you.{nl}I've been living with the blessing from the Goddesses for the last 600 years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008557	And I've met you at the end.{nl}And you pulled me to the place where the revelation is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008558	It is my honor since I can be helpful to you. {nl}I was suffering from the sense of shame since I don't know what the half guardian could do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008559	Let's finish the explanation here and go look for the revelation of the Goddesses.{nl}I have things to prepare so I will go there first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008560	Ah, you still haven't left?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008561	I've thought about it a lot. {nl}I am sure that the person who've been to this deep is just me among the grave thieves!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008562	We should record this historic moment.{nl}Can you bring some stones where I could record my achievements?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008563	What should I write on the stones? {nl}If you have any thoughts, please let me know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008564	I know that it is hard to bring somethig that is that big.{nl}謝謝你. I will think what to write on it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008565	Isn't this the diary of Ruklys? {nl}I am sure that more than this. Can you look for more?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008566	When you bring this to Wilhelmina Carriot, she will pay you accordingly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008567	Okay. This is enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008568	The history which we know are all lies. He was killed by the hands of the one he used to love.{nl}Ruklys, he is an unfortunate man.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008569	It's good to see that you are still alive.{nl}Do you remember? When I first looked through this Monocle.{nl}I thought the object is hidden by the special force, but when I went there there were only demons there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008570	And when you entered the habitants' area, you've checked it with Monocle right?{nl}The strong force was detected so I remember that I told you to check.{nl}You told me that there is only an old manager there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008571	Since then, I've been keep looking for that force with this monocle... {nl}But, when I went to the places, only demons were there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008572	Maybe...{nl}The true nature of the force that can be seen by Monocle is maybe... demons?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008573	That old manager... I have no idea...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008574	I hope my assumptions are wrong.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008575	The demons did not attack Premier Eminent? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008576	I need to check it. {nl}Let's go together and meet that Eminent guy. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008577	We will know for sure if you check that guy with the Monockle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008578	Mirtis is gone but the Vubbes are still following Mirtis's commands. {nl}And there is also a rumor that even stronger and more dangerous Vubbes were seen. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008579	Most of them died while returning with the prince's men.{nl}But they were not guided by the Goddess even after their death. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008580	I want to mourn for those who died unfairly. {nl}Would you like to join me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008581	Chapparition will not bring back the lives of those who died.{nl}It's a sad thing.. But we can't just leave it like that.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008582	What? You're not a reaper? {nl}But since you've seen my face, you will be cursed. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008583	Huhu. Poor guy. He won't be able to see the light soon. {nl}Whether it's in prison or coffin, only he will know. {nl} I feel sorry for the dead soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008584	The Legwyn family was a renowned family. {nl}But since Justina's father, Gailius Legwyn disappeared, other members of the family and its deities all fell sick and died. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008585	The mansion where Justina used to live... is now full of monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008586	I heard that Erikas who is the friend of Legwyn for a long time has the family treasure of Legwyn family so I barely managed to arrive here...{nl}But, I didn't expect she would behave like this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008587	So he doesn't even know where the grave of Legwyn family is...{nl}I feel like he is a liar.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008588	Then we have no choice.{nl}As Erikas said, can you find Legwyn at Mires Grave using the scroll for the dead?{nl}I will stay here so that Erikas would not escape.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008589	So she didn't really tell us the location of Legwyn grave because she doesn't know...?{nl}Didn't she say she would tell you if you give her some money?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008590	The one who woke me up as I was about to go beside the Goddesses... {nl}Okay. Do you need anything from me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008591	There was a story behind that. But, what Erikas said is right.{nl}I was chasing after the hunter of Kartas with my subordinates.{nl}But, it was too much for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008592	So I've told Erikas who used to live near there to lend us her power to defeat the hunter of Kartas.{nl}Erikas asked for some collateral in return for lending us the blessed crystal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008593	He told me that we would be able to defeat the hunter with that crystal.{nl}But, it was difficult for us to just seal that demon.{nl}We substituted our lives for sealing that demon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008594	The hunter of Kartas is locked inside the seal in front of you.{nl}The power that is restraining the demon is the blessed crystal that was lended by Erikas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008595	The hunter of Kartas will not be able to get out from there if we leave him like that.{nl}But, my daughter... We should look for the famly treasure for Justina who is left alone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008596	I can unleash the hunter of Kartas from the seal alone, but{nl}In order to maintain the power of the crystal, we would need help from the subordinates.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008597	But, I don't want to ask for help to Erikas again...{nl}If you could gather the scent of spirits that are growing on Mochia Hills, I would be able to wake up my subordinates.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008598	When we encountered that demon, someone had to keep concentrating on the crystal.{nl}As each person fell down, we had less number of people to focus on the crystal and the circumstances got worsened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008599	Eventually, everyone dedicated their lives to seal the hunter of Kartas.{nl}But, since me and my subordinates don't have bodies, we won't get disturbed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008600	I can feel some sacred power within you.{nl}If you could eliminate that demon, we will help.{nl}Please complete the task that we couldn't complete...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008601	There was some pitiful girl that I was taking care of.{nl}She didn't have families and she was so quiet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008602	As she started to stay in my mansion, the demons started to appear near the mansion...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008603	And an incident occured where one of my subordinates was killed by poison. {nl}Of course, everyone suspected that girl.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008604	Eventually, that girl ran away. {nl}I don't know why, but deep inside my heart, there was some voice echoing to protect her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008605	Since we were able to tie up the hunter of Kartas here, she was able to run away safely.{nl}Although, it turned out like this, I don't have any regrets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008606	It's not that I did that for good faith.{nl}But, I feel sorry for my family... that they couldn't see Justina.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008607	The scent of the spirits have the power to pull out the memories of the dead.{nl}I will put the power of the scroll of the dead here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008608	As you were able to pull me out, you will be able to pull out my subordinates.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008609	My subordinates are sleeping in the pond of Cruva.{nl}I feel sorry that I could not prepare a good spot for their graves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008610	You will be able to wake up my subordinates when you rub the scent of spirits onto the stone graves.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008611	I am to blame for it.{nl}They are like family and they are lieing on the ground without avoiding the severe wind...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008612	I am happy to meet my subordinates again because of you,.{nl}Look at their spirits with great determination. They will fulfill our mission even after their deaths.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008613	Let's pull out the hunter of Kartas from now on.{nl}But, the power of the blessed crystal is too strong so there's no way that I could unleash that demon...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008614	Then, I have no choice, but to use some dirty method.{nl}To weaken the strong sacred power, we need some evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008615	Defeat the monsters and bring some Wrongful Teeth.{nl}With that, if we weaken the power of the crystal, that demon would try to come out without knowing that it's a trap.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008616	And that will be our last chance to eliminate it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008617	Thanks for helping me this far.{nl}Now, listen to the last wish of the dead...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008618	I can feel some evil energy.{nl}Since I don't want you get dirty, let's finish this quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008619	Place the Wrongful Teeth near the seal. {nl}Then, our last mission will start.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008620	Everything is over...{nl}It is so fortunate that it ended even after our deaths
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008621	Thanks. Please pass this crystal to my daughter's friend.{nl}Now, I will return to the Goddesses with my subordinates.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008622	When you meet my daughter, please tell her that I am so sorry.{nl}And that I love her... please don't forget.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008623	Who is that girl who Legwyn tried to protect til his death?{nl}But, I am sure that he will rest in peace. Since his last mission has been fulfilled.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008624	Now, I will return this to Erikas.{nl}I really appreciate for your help on behalf of my friend, Justina Legwyn.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008625	I can tell this to you freely.{nl}The keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen... I came out from the Star Tower with my colleagues to protect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008626	The predecessor leader died suspiciously and Ignas became the next leader of the tower of stars.{nl}And then his tyranny started.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008627	He told everyone that the old rules of Lydia Schaffen should be abondoned and everything should start again...{nl}He told us to eliminate everything that was related to Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008628	But, Lydia Schaffen was the everything of the Star Tower and she was the symbolic figure of all archers.{nl}After we gained our conciousness, we were running away with our colleagues with the keepsakes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008629	Right now... I can hardly move due to the injury.{nl}But, if I stay like this, the chasers would find out about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008630	I think we should move.{nl}Can you lure the chasers so that I could go to Guoda Empty Lot?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008631	When we fire this disposable signal bomb, they will follow you.{nl}I am counting on you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008632	As you lure them, I will move secretly.{nl}Let's meet at Guoda Empty Lot.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008633	We were able to move safely due to your help.{nl}You seem like a good person so please receive this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008634	This is the book recorded about the Roxona Conflict.{nl}I am not sure whether you are interested, but please receive it as a token of my gratitude.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008635	Ah, I came up with a good idea as the chasers ran towards the signal bomb you fired.{nl}I am going to make a trap by attaching signal bomb onto a bomb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008636	Then my colleagues would know that I am here...{nl}Maybe, we could also lure the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008637	To do so, we need to something to make smoke...{nl}But, I've used everything I've had.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008638	Good. I saw Red Leaves as I ran away. To Ruda trail. {nl}Can you collect those?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008639	Many people left the Star Tower as the tyranny of the leader Ignas continued.{nl}I tried my best to endure, but...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008640	I could not endure when he was trying to eliminate the keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008641	How come I haven't thought about this. {nl}I should have set the traps already...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008642	Lastly... can you put this trap on Ruda Trail across here?{nl}I will hide here until I get recovered.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008643	My colleagues who were on the same side with me would also be chased by now.{nl}We were to meet at Orsha, but I don't know how far they've come...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008644	How come you have the signal bombs of Irmantas?{nl}You must be either brave or stupid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008645	Our brothers who were on my side are also being chased at the moment.{nl}We were gonna meet at Orsha, but I don't know how far they've come.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008646	So you are the one who helped Irmantas.{nl}Hmm. Are you that hurt?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008647	I want to get together with Irmantas, but I am not alright.{nl}We may stop ourselves each other.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008648	I will go to Orsha from here.{nl}I am sorry, but can you hand this over to him?{nl}Just tell him that it is taken from the Star Tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008649	I will leave first.{nl}I've heard that Alina is also wandering around here...{nl}I hope you can find her if possible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008650	Who are you?{nl}You don't seem to be the chaser of Ignas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008651	Ah... You've already met Irmantas and Grazina.{nl}That's good. I have to meet Irmantas right away since I have the words to pass him!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008652	I've seen it for sure.{nl}The demons were among the chasers of Ignas.{nl}They seemed to be close to each other.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008653	I am sure Ignas has colluded with the demons.{nl}I think eliminating the keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen is a part of that collusion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008654	But, I was badly hurt as wel...{nl}I am not sure if I can meet Irmantas again in my life.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008655	Can you defeat the monsters around here so I can get to him?{nl}If you reduce the number of monsters, then the possibility of getting detected by monsters will be lowered.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008656	At first, I thought the chasers that were following from the Star Tower were subordinates of Ignas.{nl}But, they weren't. There's something we don't know yet!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008657	It noisy around here so I guess the chasers are near.{nl}We should move fast.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008658	If we just stay here, then we would get attacked without notifying anything...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008659	Please take me to Irmantas.{nl}We have to tell the ones who are following the determination of Lydia Schaffen that they are colluded with the demons!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008660	If only I didn't get this injury, they are easy to defeat...{nl}Where is Irmantas now?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008661	No... I feel like I am going to lose my conciousness if I walk little more.{nl}I feel like I am hearing the voices... of the Goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008662	After I ran away from the Star Tower, I've never seen a person who is so kind and reliable like you.{nl}If something happens to me... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008663	Please tell Irmantas about the plot of Iganas with this letter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008664	Let's go. {nl}I will cheer myself up a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008665	What happened?{nl}I think I've heard a some noise from down there...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008666	Illina... was attacked?{nl}How can Ignas do something without going crazy!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008667	I will follow the words of Lydia Schaffen on behalf of Illina.{nl}I will arrive at Orsha no matter what takes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008668	To you... I want to give you some rewards since you've protected me til the end.{nl}I am sure Illina and Lydia Schaffen also want me to do that.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008669	Please feed that black herb to Agatas.{nl}As it gets detoxified, the weak body of a human will suffer severe pains, but that will be better than dying.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008670	Go your way after saving the life of Agatas.{nl}In the name of the Demon Lord, Hauberk, I will never forget you since you've saved my contractor.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008671	You are the one with a strong spirit.{nl}When they rushed in, I thought my revenge towards Giltine has ended.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008672	They followed here to obtain the power of my spirit.{nl}You and Agastas will be in danger...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008673	I think Agatas would not gain the conciousness for a while...{nl}For this innocent human and yourself, I want you to do something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008674	I have a way to eliminate the head of the demons.{nl}Please take care of the piece of my spirit which Agatas has for a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008675	In order to move my spirit piece, I need the crystal that possesses the demonic energy.{nl}Please get the shadow essence from the demons at Pakavi fields.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008676	With that power, I will be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008677	I can't quit this journey.{nl}Only I can eliminate Giltine and her subordinates from this world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008678	As you ripped me off, I will get a revenge on them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008679	This will be enough.{nl}I promise to you. If you help me, I will fight against the demons for the Goddesses and the humans.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008680	If you hate the demons, then you can trust me.{nl}The ones who've been betrayed will never forget.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008681	When the spirit was ripped in pieces, I decided myself.{nl}If I would have to look for my spirit for thousands of years, I will never forget them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008682	The power of the spirit if gradually recovering with the demonic power.{nl}The knowledge I've forgotten is gradually coming back.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008683	The head of the ones who are chasing me should be looking for me now.{nl}For the start of the new journey, I will make them feel the fear of the ones who are being chased...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008684	Defeat the demons using the power of my soul stone.{nl}If you defeat them, I will use them as the source to call out my subordinates.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008685	Please find my hidden spirit from the unoccupied grave at Badova Highway.{nl}I couldn't be with Agatas, but it will be possible if I am with you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008686	To get a revenge on the ones who are chasing me, I have to put him in danger.{nl}He must be hiding somewhere and looking at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008687	Is he still confident?...{nl}Or does he feel fear since I am with a competent individual like you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008688	This will be enough.{nl}Now is the time to find my ripped spirit again!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008689	Let's go to Salaisvin Wilderness.{nl}If I could only combine the pieces of my spirit, I would be able to put the guy who is chasing me into a danger.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008692	1st Page of the Roxona Conflict
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008693	Lydia Schaffen was a master of archery.{nl}She could even hit the feelers of a small insect.{nl}She stood in front of the great knight Ruklys.{nl}She held her breath and slowly drew her bow.{nl}It wasn't that long ago when Lydia Schaffen stood against Ruklys who used to be her lover.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008694	It was a day in the winter time.{nl}The tyranny of Kadumel King started getting extreme.{nl}Never-ending labor, starving people, corrupted landlords and a violent king...{nl}Ruklys could not stand what he was seeing in the kingdom.{nl}Revolt.{nl}Everyone in Roxona believed that Ruklys will win.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008695	The spring had come and Ruklys was still in high spirits.{nl}Ruklys obtained the information that there was a village where the thieves who'd collided with the kingdom soldiers are living.{nl}The soldiers were so corrupted...{nl}Ruklys decided to attack the village with his subordinates.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008696	He was just fighting against the thieves, but some unknown tension made Ruklys to hold his sword more firmly.{nl}A few of his colleagues fell down with the blood bursting out from their chests.{nl}At the same time, Ruklys and his subordinates ran towards the village.{nl}They didn't need to horn the pipe to let everyone know the battle has started.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008697	They possessed a decent level of archery and martial arts.{nl}The doubts which Ruklys had in his mind also disappeared.{nl}It was certain that they were not normal thieves...{nl}Ruklys held his sword on his other hand.{nl}He noticed something strange as the time passed by, but that was after many people died.{nl}In the darkness, the battle continued.{nl}Ruklys managed to win the battle at the end, but he felt somewhat uncomfortable.{nl}Long after the battle, he found out that the village was the hometown of Lydia Schaffen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008698	The ones who've been betrayed would never forget about anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008699	Many things which I've forgotten have become mine.{nl}But, don't worry.{nl}You are the companion of my journey.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008700	Please return my soul stone. {nl}I will get prepared to summon my subordinates.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008701	Let's defeat the leader with me.{nl}The shadow essences which you've collected told me that he is hidden in Paskavi Fields.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008702	Pull him out!{nl}I will be with you soon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008703	If you are afraid, you could give up. I will complete the betrayal alone.{nl}I just hope that my contractor would not be hurt again...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008704	Thanks for fighting with me, companion.{nl}I will be with you when you and your colleagues fall into great pains and danger.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008705	Agatas carried out the contract diligently.{nl}I will leave him and start the journey of the revenge.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008706	The pieces of me that are spreaded all over this world...{nl}They will become one spirit with me some day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008707	If you meet them on your journey, please help them.{nl}My spirits will rely on you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008708	This is the reward for the contract I've made with Agatas.{nl}Please put that in his pocket.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008709	Farewell, companion.{nl}I will never forget you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008710	I will look for whereabouts of my other spirits here.{nl}Companion, we will meet again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008711	I've put the spirit seperation potion{nl}into my pocket.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008712	Oh, you're here. {nl}Let's trace back what was seen in the soul's memory. {nl}If we could revive the Ruklys's device, then it will guide us to the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008713	I know where the device of Ruklys is but we need its parts to fix it. {nl}I will check on the left side so you check on the right.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008714	We'll need the parts to repair the device. {nl}Look for it on the right side.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008715	You're here? {nl}What did Eminent say? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008716	Good thing he doesn't seem to find anything suspicious. {nl}We must not give any parts to Eminent until the magic circle of Ruklys is activated.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008717	I figured the location of the magic circle as written in the document. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008718	First, the magic circle under Slypti Watchtower. {nl}The writings on the pole were erased so the magic circle is not working. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008719	It will work when you write on it again. {nl}I'll take care of the magic circle below so I'll leave this to you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008720	Be sure not to be caught by Eminent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008721	I saw the magic circles activate. Are you ok? {nl}What about Eminent? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008722	You defeated Eminent and obtained the revelation? {nl}Wow, you're way better than I thought... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008723	Anyway, I also feel like I've helped bring peace to the world and it beats my heart. {nl}But I still have some work to do. You know, right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008724	I feel lucky to have met you among the many Revelators. {nl}You saved the world, right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008725	I hope you stay safe, more than anything. {nl}May the Goddess bless you!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008726	Uh... Is that an army note? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008727	Right. Those belong to my colleagues. {nl}I don't know when it would be, but I want to send their keepsakes back to their hometown someday.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008728	Speaking of which, could you give me that army note?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008729	Hopefully, I will be able to return to hometown together with the keepsakes of my colleagues. {nl}And my colleagues would surely want that too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008730	I will surely bring it back to hometown. {nl}My fellows will want that too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008731	Come to think of it, there was a Goddess's divine object in Sielva Prayer Room. {nl}I think offering a prayer to that divine object will give us some answers. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008732	The dead ones that wake up again are the problems. {nl}Why don't we purify them and keep them from waking up. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008733	We break their coffin before they wake up. {nl}Even for the dead ones, it will be better than forcibly waking up. {nl}What do you think? Will you help?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008734	You must be careful not to open the coffin lid when you break the coffin. {nl}When the coffin opens, the dead will jump out and attack.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008735	Good work. {nl}I'm sure they will also 謝謝你 for making them rest in peace. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008736	The problem is that divine object. {nl}I can't approach anywhere near it because of the barrier.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008737	Maybe the gravekeeper would know something about the divine object and the barrier...{nl}But the gravekeeper doesn't like me. We had a thing in the past. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008738	I met the gravekeeper while working on purifying in the name of the Goddess. {nl}I was actually helping the gravekeeper but he was really mad about it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008739	The gravekeeper stands at the end of Vevapi Aisle. {nl}Can you ask him about the divine object of the Goddess for me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008740	A divine object of the Goddess? {nl}What. Are you in a team with that rude 邪靈祭司? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008741	Get out of this grave site. {nl}Just thinking about that 邪靈祭司 brings back my anger. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008742	That 邪靈祭司 went around breaking the coffins of the dead saying they rise back! {nl}I don't understand how he can do such a thing with a sane mind!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008743	Divine object that you can't even approach... {nl}I understand if they block the monsters or demons from getting close to it but even humans, that I don't understand.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008744	The people from Tree Order or something were here first before that 邪靈祭司 Juta guy. {nl}They claimed that they were officially acknowledged by Goddess Zemyna or something? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008745	They said they'd carry out the will of the Goddess Zemyna since this land was blessed by her. {nl}How could I have stopped that. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008746	But since their arrival, the dead started to rise again. {nl}If that was on purpose, there couldn't have been an insult worse than that! {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008747	That was giving me a headache already then some 邪靈祭司 comes along breaking the coffins. {nl}Breaking the coffins to purify the dead does not show any respect for the dead!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008748	That is not important. {nl}I want to calm all this fuss as soon as possible. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008749	If you help me, then I will believe you that the 邪靈祭司 didn't come here with bad intentions. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008750	Burying it back on the ground is not all. {nl}Pay respect to the dead using this match and cremate their bodies.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008751	What are you waiting for! Move quickly! {nl}I cannot.. handle it anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008752	Sorry for being sharp a while ago. I was a bit sensitive. {nl}Actually, having to point the blades to people whom I should take care of as a gravekeeper is not something I am comfortable with. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008753	謝謝你 for giving them peace for me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008754	Anyway, I know of the divine object of the Goddess that the 邪靈祭司 mentioned.{nl}Those guys from Tree of Truth order made it one day. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008755	Maybe that is why the dead rose... {nl}I had my suspicions but I couldn't approach it either. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008756	Ah! That's right. {nl}Since long time ago, some 邪靈祭司 or Necromancer not in their sane minds used to come here secretly. {nl}They used to do insane experiments on the dead who are rested in here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008757	So my father learned how to make 薩滿 dolls from the guards nearby 克萊佩達. {nl}He said if you put spells on the 薩滿 dolls, it finds the power that messes with the grave and destroys it or something? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008758	There is a box in Kansias Stone Chamber with my father's belongings. {nl}There should be a 薩滿 doll in it. {nl}I don't think I can.. make it through the bodies.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008759	Our family has been gravekeepers for generations. {nl}My father passed away during the disaster on Medis Diena so I took his place since then. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008760	I only learned over hid shoulders... {nl}But I am the gravekeeper of this place now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008761	Right! This is it.{nl}It wasn't used for a long time, but it should work well since father made it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008762	Done. Now go to the divine object. {nl}If that divine object is the reason behind the dead rising here, the 薩滿 doll will break the barrier and destroy the divine object.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008763	It's the 薩滿 doll that father used. {nl}If we do as my father used to do, then nothing will go wrong. Just as my father used to do...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008764	If the 薩滿 doll attacked the divine object, then it means it detected an eveil enery. {nl}But the 薩滿 doll was the one destroyed... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008765	Anyway, if the barrier broke, then your friend 邪靈祭司 must be able to identify it. {nl}What about going back to that 邪靈祭司 and asking him?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008766	Huh? You really broke the barrier? {nl}See, I knew the gravekeeper would help. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008767	Actually, I was a but suspicious myself. {nl}I felt a bad aura from the barrier considering that it was something that covered the divine object of the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008768	Anyway, since the barrier is now broken, let's go together. {nl}If it really is a divine object of the Goddess, then it will react to the prayer for the Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008769	Will you go ahead first? {nl}I will follow as soon as I'm ready for the prayer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008770	A 薩滿 doll.. Evil energy... It really is suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008771	謝謝你 for saving me. I almost went to the Goddess. {nl}I guess it is a lie that it was a divine object of the Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008772	The object of the Goddess would not summon such a monster. {nl}I smell something fishy with that Tree of Truth order.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008773	Since the object here was not real, now we must find the trace of Goddess Zemyna from somewhere else. {nl}It's ok. If something like this makes me frustrated, then I would not have kept my journey until here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008774	But before I leave, I must help the gravekeeper and keep the fuss down. {nl}Now that the evil object is gone, my abilities will help keep this place calm. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008775	I want to show my sincerity to the gravekeeper, but the image of him being angry at me holds me back. {nl}If you're on the way to the gravekeeper, can you send him my sincerity as well?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008776	No wonder. That object wasn't that of the Goddess. {nl}Using the name of the Goddess into tricks like this. They have crossed the line. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008777	I want to go and make them pay for it right away. {nl}But as a gravekeeper, keeping this place secure comes first. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008778	Was that 邪靈祭司's name Juta? {nl}His ability powers will be of much help. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008779	The Tree of Truth order went in to the Kalail Mausoluem. {nl}They said they will find something to carry out their order or something...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008780	If ever you go to Kalail Mausoleum, be careful about them. {nl}No matter how much I think about it, they are not in their right minds. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008781	If this is not it either, I can't help but be exhausted. {nl}Where do you think Goddess Zemyna has gone?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008782	Oh my god, the Divine Tree! {nl}The Divine Tree answered my prayers and sent someone to save me!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008783	謝謝你. I thought death is the only option for me. {nl}I am Gintas, a follower of the Tree of Truth order. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008784	We, the Tree of Truth order, believe in the Divine Tree that stands tall in the kingdom. {nl}The Divine Tree is punishing the foolish people whose greed are soaring up high. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008785	Our order will be the appointed ones of the Divine Tree and guide the world in opening a new age. {nl}Right. Are you interested in joining our order? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008786	You are really strong, just as someone sent by the Divine Tree should be. {nl}Such strength should be used for something bigger.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008787	I am collecting the spirit of the dead that rose back, as the order told me to. {nl}Margiris can read the memories of the dead when they were alive from the spirit stones.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008788	She find the sins of the dead from their memories and forgives it to purify the sins in this world. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008789	But I seem to have sprained my ankle while running away from the dead. I can't walk. {nl}Can you help me by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008790	I'm sure my prayers reached the Divine Tree to send you here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008791	Brother. {nl}By this, your sins have become lighter.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008792	There is something you need to help us with. {nl}Think of it as a test and do your best. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008793	Carrying out sacred missions can get you to some trouble like just a while ago. {nl}You can also lose your life. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008794	Bodies of followers are brought to Seima Stone Chamber and their sins are purified. {nl}But because of Margiris' sacred abilities, some actually get their life back. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008795	The followers who rise back can't throw away their regrets in life and keep roaming around this place. {nl}Please use this flint to cremate the regrets and souless bodies of the dead.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008796	Margiris told us salvation is not something we can get so easily. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008797	This work purifies the sins of the foolish as well as ours. {nl}Those who die during the process is because their belief is not enough. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008798	Only those who stand it will earn salvation.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008799	Poor Gintas... {nl}You've stood the despair of death alone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008800	Hey. If you are thinking of joining the order, don't bother. {nl}I, myself, used to be a follower of Margiris. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008801	I used to focus on purifying the sins of the dead like Gintas. {nl}I thought I would earn salvation. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008802	But one day, I saw the record books of Margiris. {nl}As far as I knew, those book keep a record of the process of purifying the sins of the dead. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008803	But it was actually a record of land ownership. {nl}And I also found out that he was looking for the record of the Kalail in here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008804	When I read until that part of the books, Margiris killed me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008805	Amazing. Did righteousness bring you here?{nl}Look. Defeating Margiris does not mean anything. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008806	If Margiris' mission fails, the order will send someone else in here... {nl}And innnocent disciples will turn like this agian. {nl}Nothing will change.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008807	If you really want to stop the order, then you need to find out their true objective. {nl}Find the record of Kalail first. {nl}You need to stop the order from getting their hands on Kalail's records.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008808	What? {nl}You met a soul of follower in there? {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008812	Margiris is along the way to Kalail's grave. {nl}If you bring this to him, he will acknowledge your contributions.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008813	Don't tell Gintas about the story of Kalail. {nl}He won't believe it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008814	I want to save you buy I don't know how...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008815	Who are you? {nl}Ah, it's the Gintas's Seal of Truth. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008816	There are too many people who want to join the order for salvation. {nl}Anyway, welcome.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008817	I think my ankle is getting better so a little more rest will do. {nl}Please be careful and may we meet again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008818	Sorry to ask you when you've just joined the order, but there is something we need you to do. {nl}We are cleansing the sins of those who have died here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008819	I woke the soul of Kalail. {nl}He used to take some land of the Kingdom when he was alive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008820	He was not able to let go of that even after this death. {nl}He did a document of sins somewhere in this gravesite. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008821	To save his soul, we must find the hidden document and make him let go of the his regrets from the time he was alive. {nl}But there seems to be greed left in him and he won't speak up about the whereabout of the document. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008822	Can you try to persuade Kalail? {nl}Since he doesn't know your face, try to act as if you're not part of the order. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008823	If you find out the whereabouts of the documents, I will bless you with the grace of Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008824	You just won't give up, do you. {nl}I don't know who you are or what you want. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008825	What are you asking from me and bugging me when you don't even tell me what it is for.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008826	I will understand if you play rough with him in case he doesn't listen to you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008827	What are you? {nl}Why are you disturbing other people's gravesites? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008828	I have lived my life honestly.{nl}And you think I have hidden some document with the record of my sins?{nl}Stop speaking nonsense and go away!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008829	If you are really on the Goddess' side, then you have no reason to stand seeing something that disgrace her name. {nl}What are you waiting for? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008830	Such awful peopel. {nl}Setting that up as a sacred object... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008831	I think that seal has weakend the energy of that thing. {nl}It must have thought that we're on the same side. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008832	Anyway, since you've taken care of that horrible thing, I will believe what you say.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008833	No wonder it was suspicious. That leader wasn't human! {nl}Right, that thing wasn't human... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008834	Why are they making such a fuss in this grave. What are they after?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008835	After hearing your story, it seems that they are after the ownership of the villa in Kaliss Province. {nl}There is a copy of the list of villa owners that I used to handle when I was alive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008836	They must have wanted to get their hands on that copy and use it to make false testimony claiming that the lands in Kaliss belong to them. {nl}Fortunately, it seems like they were not able to find it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008837	I suspected something like this to happen and hid the list in Seima Stone Chamber. {nl}Can you gather the scattered list of villa owners?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008838	The villa ownership is supposed to be managed by the next generation of deputies... {nl}But he was not someone to be trusted so I requested that the manuscript of records be buried with me when I die in my will. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008839	He may look like a good guy but he even as a public official, he had private meetings with unknown people... {nl}And I caught him forging records at one point.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008840	It bring chills thinking that they could have found the records. {nl}If they are preying on each province records like this, then only Kaliss but the whole kingdom will fall under the hands of the demons soon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008841	Good thing you're her. {nl}That is the record of land owners in Kaliss province.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008842	Now we have to engrave the 薩滿 doll with the energy that messes the grave. {nl}I saw the site where they cremated the dead a shile ago and there was a black crystal that I've never seen before. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008843	I'm sure the black crystals are the traces of evil magic that woke up the dead. {nl}Can you get more of it from the dead that rose?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008844	Ah, I will take care of the fallen dead bodies. {nl}For now there is something more important to do.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008845	Yeah, this will be enough. {nl}I will prepare the 薩滿 doll right away. Hold on.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008846	What? You are not a follower of that order? {nl}Are you telling me to believe you? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008847	Alright. {nl}Then destroy that divine object that they claim to have received the blessings of the Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008848	I have never seen a blessed diving object fume evil energy. {nl}I think that object is messing this gravesite.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008849	I brought the Kaliss land owners list to my grave to stop the corruption of the next generation. {nl}But to think of it, this record has now become useless. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008850	Since they will siege for this document again. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008851	I will give this record to you. {nl}If you make sure destroy it, I will be able to lay in peace again. {nl}Please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008852	It doesn't make sense no matter how much I think of it. {nl}How did they find this place.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008853	Villa ownership is actually a very sensitive matter so the records are not really known to public. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008854	Only the current deputy knows that I have handled the records. {nl}How did they know about this place...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008855	But it is strange. {nl}To have a barrier blocking people from approaching the divine object.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008856	Even if it is sacred, if that is how it is, no one can approach it. {nl}I mean, it's as if it doesn't want anybody to come near it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008857	Place this Soul Stone then defeat the dead nearby.{nl}The souls of the dead will be absorbedinto this stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008858	This cleanses the sins of the dead and yours too. {nl}Also, Margiris will be very happy about it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008859	Good luck then.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008860	Ashak Underground Prison
