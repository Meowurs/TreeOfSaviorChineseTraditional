QUEST_20150317_000672	The Pedigree of Magic
QUEST_20150317_000673	Magic, at the beginning, began from the investigation of mana {nl}and the review of basic elements.
QUEST_20150317_000674	After that, the basic senses, religious belief of the 女神es, {nl}and mathematical approaches were mixed to find areas for expansion.

QUEST_20150317_000676	The Report of the High Barrier Magic
QUEST_20150317_000677	The barrier in this tower could not have possibly been created by the Demon Lord.
QUEST_20150317_000678	It is like a tight-knit net. {nl}Someone with a normal level of divine power cannot escape from it.
QUEST_20150317_000679	For what reason was this barrier created?{nl}Is it related to the fact that the 女神 who controls the flames of this world is staying here?
QUEST_20150317_000680	Agailla Flurry called Gabija to this tower, so this barrier is not meant to lock Gabija in. {nl}To find out the reason for this, we first have to understand the composition of the barrier.
QUEST_20150317_000681	After a long investigation, we've found that this barrier was {nl}not only created by the power of Helgasercle, but also with other kinds of mana.
QUEST_20150317_000682	We've also found that mana was composed by aligning the foundation stones in a certain position.

QUEST_20150317_001079	Revelation of Mage Tower
QUEST_20150317_001080	It is an old story of Fedimian before the 女神像.
QUEST_20150317_001081	A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were ordinary {nl}- not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. {nl}However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.
QUEST_20150317_001082	The people of Fedimian were very cautious. In the sense that they take the word 'cautious' much more seriously. {nl}These people were as cautious around fire as they were without.
QUEST_20150317_001083	The Fedimians were modest about this with others. {nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait.
QUEST_20150317_001084	Thanks to this behavior, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, as they were able to sense danger coming.
QUEST_20150317_001085	Because of this, no few words are said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people.
QUEST_20150317_001086	At Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it will be gone forever. In a world where money is mostly silver coin, only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner.
QUEST_20150317_001087	Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {nl}Some people believe the 女神 Zemyna absorbs money that makes contact with her area. {nl}But most commoners believe this was done to reduce the demand of silver coins from creditors.
QUEST_20150317_001088	By believing that the 女神 herself takes the silver, the people found it fruitless trying to dig up silver on her grounds. {nl}The fact that you can offer silver coin at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.
QUEST_20150317_001089	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20150317_001090	However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {nl}More so with the case of young girls. {nl}One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001091	Normally, when one drops silver coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, and then disappear without a trace. {nl}Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happens.
QUEST_20150317_001092	To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. {nl}In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal.

QUEST_20150317_001094	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001095	Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001096	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001097	Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {nl}Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience.
QUEST_20150317_001098	Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian where she worked. {nl}There, while one could just pick fruit from the trees, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground.
QUEST_20150317_001099	Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {nl}Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands were smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children.
QUEST_20150317_001100	Moving back, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife. {nl}He, like all other Fedimians, knew about the phenomenon, and saw no reason to give Aiste more money.

QUEST_20150317_001104	It is for this reason that he lives on the outskirts of Fedimian. {nl}Aiste knocked on the front door and explained her situation to him as soon as he answered.

Inside, he was surprised to find dozens of silver coins. {nl}Now he understood why Aiste was able to depart much more quickly than she arrived - she had lightened her load by giving him the excess.
QUEST_20150317_001129	For a beggar who had been stingy over a single silver coin, the fact Aiste could simply give away several tens of times that amount moved him. {nl}The fact that Aiste, who had went off and solved the mystery of Fedimian, came back and gave him what she really didn't owe, made the beggar thankful.
QUEST_20150317_001130	The more he thought, the less the beggar was able to hold back his tears. {nl}As he cried, he noticed something odd - every shining teardrop that touched the ground transformed to silver coins.
QUEST_20150317_001131	The beggar could not believe his eyes, but quickly remembered Aiste words about a blessing from the 女神. {nl}After a while, the beggar stopped crying, and went to pick up the coins and put them in the bag Aiste gave him.
QUEST_20150317_001132	A few days later, the beggar went to the statue that Aiste prayed to.

Everyone agreed that finally, the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian has come to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001134	After some time, word of this occurrence reached the king. Curious as to why this happened, the king ordered an investigation. {nl}The hidden truth was brought to light, and Aiste's story was known.
QUEST_20150317_001135	The king praised the people that caused the miracle with their charitable hearts. {nl}Additionally, to honor the grace of the 女神, he decided to spend the national treasury to build a large statue dedicated to her.
QUEST_20150317_001136	On the day the statue was finally completed, {nl}something miraculous happened as the King and Aiste went together to make the first offering. {nl}From the circumference of the statue sprouted coins - all the silver coins that had been lost by Fedimians up until that time.
QUEST_20150317_001137	After heated debate, the Fedimian people decided to not to hoard their lost silver coins. {nl}Instead, they asked the king to collect all the coins and distribute them among the poor of the Kingdom. {nl}The king readily agreed, and gave the order to record this beautiful event into the history of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20150317_001138	Even now, nobody knows when and how the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian started, {nl}but everybody knows when, how, and who helped unravel the mystery. {nl}It was through the kindness of Aiste and the people who helped her, as well as through the grace of the 女神, that the mystery came to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001139	Klaipeda 的賭徒
QUEST_20150317_001140	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001141	In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about, his wife especially so. {nl}Modestas was not lazy nor very clever nor not too foolish. {nl}He did not drink or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he loved to gamble.
QUEST_20150317_001142	During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - {nl}but whenever he earned more than he really needed, he would gamble. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.
QUEST_20150317_001143	Whenever she could, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the 女神' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until one peculiar day.
QUEST_20150317_001144	Like most of his days, Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coin. {nl}He was walking through the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when he saw a strange, old woman on the road.
QUEST_20150317_001145	This old woman seemed not only old and frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if deep in thought or obsessed with whatever she was doing. {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.
QUEST_20150317_001146	To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman, was what she held in her hands. {n]}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear her mumblings, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.

QUEST_20150317_001158	In any case, as Modestas and the old woman parted ways, he knew he now had a dangerous power guaranteeing his victory at any time in the near future. {nl} He walked, looking for the next person to bet huge on. As he wondered how much to wager on his next move, he heard the sound of galloping behind him.
QUEST_20150317_001159	Modestas turned around. It was his good old friend, Sigfried, riding on horseback towards him. {nl} They knew each other, as both had been together through the highs and lows of gambling. They exchanged greetings and talked about where they were going. Sigfried dismounted to walk at a leisurely pace with his friend, idly chatting along their way. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001160	However, before long, Modestas could no longer continue walking with Sigfried. {nl}He was fully aware of his deadline, and had no time for such trivial activities. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001161	Even during their normal everyday conversations, Modestas and Sigfried unconsciously made big and small bets. Eventually, one would utter the word, 'Bet?' unconsciously. {nl} Neither of them were rich so these bets weren't ever that big. Knowing this would trigger the curse, Modestas really wanted to ask Sigfried to leave. {nl} In the end, Modestas uttered these words: {nl}

QUEST_20150317_001166	另一方面, Sigfried was understandably confident, knowing with certainty that he would win the gamble, thus, he was alright with betting his horse. {nl}With only a little money at hand, the bet became too good to refuse, and Modestas finally accepted. {nl} And, as expected, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001167	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001168	For Modestas, who had always been elated upon winning bets and depressed upon losing them, to win and feel depressed was a first in his entire life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001169	Knowing he had just deceived his long-time gambling friend, Sigfried, and also missed an opportunity to earn a lot of money, Modestas felt conflicted, and walked slowly alongside the horse he had just won. {nl} While walking, Modestas remembered the earlier warnings of his unconditional bet results. He realized that now, with his upcoming defeat, he is doomed to not earn any more silver than he started with.
QUEST_20150317_001170	While walking along the road, Modestas encountered a group of soldiers. {nl} Upon looking closer, the soldiers seemed to be arguing about what to buy at a store. {nl} Modestas decided not to interfere and pass them, but the soldiers noticed him and called. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001171	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001172	Modestas was surprised when he heard the word, 'bet', but was relieved to know he was only being asked to referee. After all, nothing could possibly happen if he was just refereeing. {nl} Modestas learned that the soldiers were fighting over which 女神 was the best. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001173	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001174	The soldiers did not tell Modestas who voted for which 女神, for fear of his decision being affected by the expressions of each individual soldier. {nl} The soldiers did tell him however, how much they have each wagered. Just by seeing the gold nuggets, he could easily figure that there was a large amount of money in this bet. {nl}

QUEST_20150317_001177	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001178	In Modestas' mind, he concluded that the quarrelling soldiers didn't have him referee, but simply added him into the bet. In reality however, he had no real claim, so he wasn't in the bet just yet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001179	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001180	In addition, because the other soldiers had already bet deeply, Modestas had to bet the only gold bullion he had. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001181	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001182	The officer inadvertently said the name of a 女神, and some of the soldiers began cheering. {nl} The officer, not knowing what's going on, simply ordered his soldiers to move on. In any case, Modestas certainly lost. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001183	Having now lost the gold bullion given to him by the strange old woman, Modestas was now at a loss. {nl} To originally intend to referee, only to end up losing all the gold he had, and knowing exactly the reason why, Modestas felt heartbroken, dumbfounded, yet understanding. A unique feeling. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001184	Although Modestas had just lost money by entering a bet started by others, it was the first time he's done so in his life. Modestas spent some time thinking of how to better his situation and {nl} suddenly got an idea, knowing he was certain to win his next bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001185	If he could call back the soldiers from earlier and bet his horse, he could certainly earn his gold back and possibly more. {nl} Knowing this, Modestas got on his horse, and sped in the direction the soldiers left towards. {nl} {nl} With speed, Modestas soon spotted a stationary wagon. Modestas lowered his speed to check out the wagon parked on the side of the road. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001186	Unfortunately, just as Modestas pulled up at the wagon, his horse suddenly reacted violently, forcing him off. Fortunately, because he had cut his speed and fell on muddy ground, he was not greatly hurt. {nl}

QUEST_20150317_001188	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001189	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001190	Modestas could see that the wagon was very durable, good-looking and has been well cared for. However, he had no immediate need for a wagon, so he hesitated. {nl} In addition, Modestas had no money now; no matter how low the wagon owner went, he did not have the money to buy. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001191	The human heart sure can be an amusing thing. {nl} Modestas, deciding the wagon was worth buying but lacking the money to do so, decided he could use his impending victory to win the wagon for free. {nl} So he proposed a bet with the wagon 導師, risking his own horse. {nl} Naturally, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001192	Modestas, having now just won a wagon and an injured horse, originally intended to keep just the wagon and his original horse. {nl} But seeing as the injured horse isn't as injured as he thought, he believed he had won big. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001193	In his mind, now that he's had obtained two horses and a wagon, he believed he was no longer in a bad situation, deciding to this time be really careful not to lose big next. {nl} So, instead of following the soldiers, he decided to go to a place where there are less people. He reined his horse and travelled away from civilization. {nl} However, even in a remote setting, he was bound to meet some people. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001194	Rare as it would be, Modestas, while moving about in a uninhabited mountain, encountered an elderly Alchemist. {nl} The old Alchemist sat on a chair on the right side of the road, a silver nugget in hand. {nl} As Modestas passed by for a closer look, the nugget turned out to not be of silver, but of lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001195	'Could this Alchemist be one who could turn lead into gold?' thought Modestas, but soon thought he was just overestimating the Alchemist. {nl} But the Alchemist, glad to see someone pass by after a long time, called out to Modestas, and suddenly proposed a bet with him. Somehow, today the whole world wants to make bets with Modestas, and he was getting tired of it. {nl} Modestas liked gambling, but to find opponents this easily was becoming a joke to him. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001196	Modestas was about to do something unlike his being and reject the bet, but the idea that he could wager low moved his mind. {nl} After all, the old Alchemist was wagering a lead nugget. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001197	Because this time he was certain to lose, Modestas believed it would be better to wager and lose against a lead nugget now than to run into people who would wager and lose a large amount of money later. {nl}Modestas first made sure that he could accept the bet now despite having no money at hand and could bring some later, and accepted the bet. No words need to be said about the result. {nl}

QUEST_20150317_001199	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001200	Instead, it was clearly gold, so in the end Modestas was betting against a gold nugget. {nl} Ultimately, a now-tired Modestas had no way of objecting against the Alchemist. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001201	Now, Modestas had lost more gold than he owed the strange old woman. {nl} And now, he only has one unconditional victory and defeat left. {nl} As Modestas lead his wagon through the rest of the mountain path, he murmured about having to make sure his next win a very big one. {nl}

QUEST_20150317_001204	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001205	Hearing about the mountain's valuable lodes, revived Modestas' habit. He even knew this time, he was certain to win. Modestas started persuading the self-proclaiming mountain to make a bet with him. The mountain, unconcerned over winning or losing this bet, agreed. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001206	For a person to have a fateful encounter with a mysterious being like this, even Modestas doubted his own sanity. {nl} In any case, Modestas bet against the mountain's ores, and won.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001207	At the end of the bet, the mountain erupted, and a large boulder landed directly in front of Modestas. It was certainly something, but the boulder didn't seem to be what Modestas expected. For the mountain, this was the gambling debt repaid. {nl} In Modestas' eyes however, there should have been veins of gold, or at least something useful like copper or coal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001208	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001209	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001210	And then suddenly anxiety struck him, as he realized that though he has an unconditional loss upcoming, given the strange things that happened up to now, he will not easily be able to control the outcome of the final bet. {nl} In any case, Modestas knew he couldn't stay where he was right now, and decided to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001211	Modestas got up and tried to move the boulder, but to no avail. It was simply too large for him to handle by himself. {nl} He considered leaving it behind, but after recalling the mountain's saying that the boulder was worth more than his two horses and wagon combined, he believed that would be a waste. {nl} Believing he could sell the boulder to a local quarry for a good amount of money, he became troubled and unable to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001212	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001213	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001214	Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl} Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl} The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001215	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001216	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001217	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001218	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl} Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked back forward, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001219	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl} On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001220	The officer returned Modesta's gold to him, and ordered his soldiers to help him transport the boulder back to Klaipeda. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001221	The officer and solders had sturdy rope, so they were able to transport the rock without worry of it falling off and unload it at Klaipeda. They decided to accompany Modestas all the way there. {nl} Modestas was very grateful for the help he got from the soldiers. {nl} Along with the soldiers, Modestas again ran into none other than the Alchemist he lost earlier against.
QUEST_20150317_001222	To Modestas, a promise was a promise, so he immediately handed over the gold the soldiers returned to him to the Alchemist. {nl} The Alchemist, surprised by how Modestas could do this with no complaints or dissatisfaction, took the gold and conversed with him.
QUEST_20150317_001223	Not wanting to be left out of the conversation between Modestas and the Alchemist, the soldiers couldn't continue working, joined in, and learned about the Alchemist's past with Modestas. {nl} The Alchemist apologized to Modestas for turning his lead into gold, and promised to gather all the support he could for Modestas at Klaipeda. He then left. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001224	Soon after, Modestas and the soldiers reached Klaipeda. They set the stone down at the large open space at the center of town. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001225	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001226	Everyone who were there on the spot favored the idea. {nl} The Alchemist took the gold he obtained from Modestas and paid it to the Dievdirbys as commission, and went to get permission from the Knight Leader and Bishop of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001227	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a 女神 Statue was planned for their city. {nl} However, one last problem remained aside from winning their favor. And that question was, which 女神 should the statue commemorate? {nl} The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001228	The one who answered this question was none other than Modestas. {nl} Without any real intent, Modestas argued that the 女神es in power have guided him via divine providence to build a statue at Klaipeda that day. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001229	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001230	However, to their bewilderment, not a single soul could recognize the 女神 whom the completed statue commemorated.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001231	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001232	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the 女神es' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001233	{memo X}
QUEST_20150317_001234	Though Modestas died an undefeated, invincible gambler, by then he had never bet anything other than the 女神' identity, living purely off the profits gained from such bets through the end of his life. {nl}

QUEST_20150511_002018	According to the old writing left on the Great Cathedral, that is using a small part of the 女神' abilities secretly. {nl}Some people say that after seducing the weak minds of people, the demons used them for the source of the curse. {nl}May the 女神 bless!
QUEST_20150511_002019	There are two ways to release the curse: {nl}Remove the curse using a greater power or eliminate its caster. {nl}
QUEST_20150511_002020	Removing the curse using a greater power: {nl}This way depends on whether the power that overwhelms the curse comes from good or evil and from darkness or light.{nl}{nl}The most important factor for eliminating the caster: {nl}Even after eliminating the caster, the curse may not be removed due to other factors.{nl}{nl}I have no doubt that the power of the 女神 is stronger.
QUEST_20150511_002021	There are mainly two ways to spread the curse. {nl}First, using equipment and uttering simple words. It sounds easy but it is, in fact, the hardest way. {nl}Therefore, from the example of the Pilgrim Path, we mainly use the cursed ones as the mediums to spread the curse.
QUEST_20150511_002022	When a caster makes a curse, the caster has a tremendous influence on the mind of the victim. Their ego usually can't endure the feeling of guilt this causes. {nl}It seems the magic that was used on the cursed city of Ruklys is of a higher level than the one used on Naktis. We need to look into it more.

QUEST_20150714_002122	從哪開始…
QUEST_20150714_002123	I was a disciple of Agailla Flurry when I was alive. {nl}I didn't have any magical abilities so I couldn't use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002124	That's why I survived Helgasercle's wrath. {nl}He must've thought he didn't have to kill me since I wasn't able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002125	I am confident I am better when it comes to theories than other disciples… {nl}That's why I studied magic. And in my studies, I learned of the magic stone of interaction.
QUEST_20150714_002126	I came here when Helgasercle attacked the Mage Tower. {nl}I thought that if I could use the magic stone of interaction, I'd be able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002127	But, Archon drove me away from the Mage Tower. Due to this disturbance, the magic stone activated defensive magic, linking my and Archon's spirit to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002128	As a result, Archon was sealed and my body disappeared without a trace. {nl}We became shackled to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002129	I've been tied here for hundreds of years… {nl}Since I can't do anything with my astral body.
QUEST_20150714_002130	The bigger problem is that Archon was released as well. {nl}I lost the body, but Archon, who is a demon, is still alive.

QUEST_20150714_002132	By avoiding the eyes of Helgasercle, I was able to come here to continue my research. {nl}I needed to find a way. A way to reduce the power of demons and increase that magical power.

QUEST_20150714_002134	I've made many magical tools, but I wasn't able to repel the attacks of the demons. {nl}Without checking out the result, I close my eyes.
QUEST_20150714_002135	The Records of Investigation
QUEST_20150714_002136	The basics of Linker Magic are to find the common factors in each others' spirits. {nl}So it is impossible if the acceptor does not possess any magical abilities or bases. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002137	I've completed the first stage magic stone. {nl}It still does not satisfy the previous objective of delivering the perfect magic and magical power somewhat, {nl}but now at last it is possible to accept Linker Magic even without magical ability.{nl}
QUEST_20150714_002138	建議書
QUEST_20150714_002139	If a magician finds a way to share all his abilities and knowledge with another, {nl}then even those without magical abilities can become a strong magician within a short period of time.
QUEST_20150714_002140	This way, you'd be able to hide from the eyes of Helgasercle who is extremely afraid of the disciple of Agailla Flurry appearing.
QUEST_20150714_002141	However, I'm not sure if this is at all possible or whether or not it will have any side effects.

QUEST_20150714_002143	The magic stone of the interaction can be made to work on the behalf of a Linker. {nl}However, maintaining the stone of interaction will require a considerable amount of magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002144	Hence, we decided to maintain the magic stone of the interaction with 12 regenerating magical power stones. {nl}If no problems arise, we will be able to maintain it, but if the magical power supply is cut, it won't last long.

QUEST_20150714_002152	The Research Records of Demetrius
QUEST_20150714_002153	In ancient times, humans lived with the 女神es. {nl}When I first heard of this piece of folklore, I thought it was made up out of respect for the 女神es. {nl}I started to investigate what historic background caused such reverence as well as why this myth was created.
QUEST_20150714_002154	I increased the extent of my research. {nl}I travelled to many regions of the kingdom and collected similar cases. {nl}And I started to believe that this story was part of a bigger truth rather than just a small truth covered in fabrication.
QUEST_20150714_002155	The facts that we've discovered so far are thus: {nl}{nl}In the beginning, or a period not that far from the beginning, all humans used to live with the 女神es underground. {nl}I suppose the 女神es used to be more directly involved with humans. {nl}I have no idea why but soon, the humans left that place and scattered across the land.
QUEST_20150714_002156	This movement was made very naturally. {nl}If that hadn't been the case, then there must have been conflicts, and more fables would have been created as a result.
QUEST_20150714_002157	I believe the 女神es erased all memory and records of that time completely. {nl}However, we can't deny the possibility that another reason may exist due to the fact that this legend still remains despite the authority of the great 女神es.
QUEST_20150714_002158	And this is a very cautious prediction, but the creatures that we call demons may exist underground. {nl}Though that theory is hard to accept when we think about all the facts that are recorded in history and the present.

QUEST_20150729_002309	An unknown force prevents you from getting closer.
QUEST_20150729_002310	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? Would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002311	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002312	'Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002313	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money. {nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002314	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002315	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002316	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002317	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'The 女神 Zemyna must be taking them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002318	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the 女神.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the 女神 to return my silverware?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002319	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at the Statue of 女神 Zemyna. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the 女神 Statue represented, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, 女神. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002320	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have come to take back what you have lost?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002321	The 女神' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what your asking from me is not in a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002322	'But I worked very hard today!'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002323	'I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002324	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002325	As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the 女神 returned all my coins. On top of that she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002326	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002327	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried about him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002328	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'The 女神 Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002329	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002330	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002331	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through 女神 Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002332	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich… but there's no life in these things…' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at baby gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002333	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If this way bears fruit, it'll be safe and secure.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002334	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002335	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002336	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - That won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002337	'No. No matter how unlucky it may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002338	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002339	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002340	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time… you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002341	'Well…' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand…' {nl}''On the other hand…'?' Modestas said, tensely.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002342	'When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object, but thought of the victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002343	'Are you not busy? You seemed in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl} Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another 10 minutes or so. This horse might not seem like much, but when it comes down to it he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002344	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl} 'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl} {nl} Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl} 'Do you not believe what I just said or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl} A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl} 'No, I didn't mean it like that……' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002345	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl} {nl} Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150729_002346	Considering Modestas' habit, to simply not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl} 'What…  what kind of bet?' {nl} 'We were going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl} Modestas desperately fought his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150729_002347	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002348	As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150729_002349	'You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl} Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl} Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl} 'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002350	What started as a small banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every 女神 got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002351	Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best 女神 is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever 女神 he supported. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002352	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his favorite 女神. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002353	When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl} There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002354	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four 女神es but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five 女神es.' {nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002355	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002356	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join.
QUEST_20150729_002357	Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002358	If you think about it, even if it was his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any of the 女神es he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his 女神 being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002359	However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. A commanding officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which 女神 he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002360	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down hurt and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002361	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002362	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002363	Modestas, after saying he'll be back if he loses the bet, began to rein his horse when the old Alchemist let out an eerie cackle. This caught Modestas' attention, who turned around and looked at his person.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002364	And right before his eyes, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and in a moment clearly became gold. {nl} The old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget, be sure to bring it.' {nl} Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002365	'This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a wealthy man at the very least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002366	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002367	'You are… the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain large valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002368	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed.{nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150729_002369	Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to his former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002370	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman asked Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002371	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman flatly added, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150729_002372	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but as an amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002373	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002374	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Since you already lost the bet against me, although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance. How about it?'{nl}Like always Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150729_002375	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys sculptor.{nl}To the famous Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a 女神 using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a 女神, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002376	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the 女神es, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002377	Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002378	When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the 女神 who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002379	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002380	Despite the numerous questions nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the 女神 Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002381	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the 女神, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002382	But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Therefore nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002383	And, as he lay dying, Modestas revealed the secret to the 女神 Statue in his will. When all became clear, the one who orchestrated all of this was none other than the one whom all other 女神es stem from, 女神 Ausrine.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002384	In the end, 女神 Ausrine, in exchange for giving income and an interesting life full of mystery to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, gave the city of Klaipeda a beautiful 女神 Statue, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl} {nl}
